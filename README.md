"Hello, my nickname is Arch Moon."

"In short, I'm a boy who wants to see life from another angle,
and programming allows me to do that."

"I'm currently focused on relearning programming from scratch.
I will record all my evolution in a diary,
which will later be published as my portfolio,
and also future projects that I will leave here on this platform."

"See you in the next chapters."
